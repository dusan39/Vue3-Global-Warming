  "titleDescription2": "This phenomenon is mainly caused by the release of Co2 and other gases which cause the temperature to rise on earth. These gases create a barrier that does not allow the sun's heat to leave the earth, generating the so-called 'greenhouse effect'.",

  "arcticInfo": "The Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the globe since 1979. The ice, once steadfast and eternal, now melts and retreats, revealing an altered world beneath. As global warming tightens its grip, the Arctic becomes a sentinel, sounding an urgent warning for our planet.",
  "co2Title": "Co2 information",
  "co2Info": "Global warming is primarily driven by the increase in greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being one of the most significant contributors. The effects of global warming on CO2 levels are part of a complex and interconnected feedback loop that amplifies the problem. ",
  "methaneTitle": "Methane information",
  "methaneInfo": "Methane is the primary contributor to the formation of ground-level ozone, a hazardous air pollutant and greenhouse gas, exposure to which causes 1 million premature deaths every year.",
  "no2Title": "No2 information",
  "no2Info": "Nitrous oxide enhances the greenhouse effect just as carbon dioxide does by capturing reradiated infrared radiation from the Earth's surface and subsequently warming the troposphere (lower atmosphere).",
  "temperatureTitle": "Temperature information",
  "temperatureInfo": "Global warming, fueled by escalating greenhouse gas emissions, intensifies Earth's temperature. It yields sweltering heatwaves, erratic weather patterns, vanishing glaciers, and unsettling ecological changes, underscoring the urgent need for climate action.",
